We are at ICASSP 2022 today for a Show & Tell demonstration for one of our recent works. If you are at the conference, please stop by to say Hi!! Join us to listen to and generate some cool audio morphs.

I started my PhD in the midst of the pandemic in 2020. While I was mentally prepared (or I thought I was) for a journey as a lone researcher, the isolation the pandemic brought had even the introvert in me jump at any chance of in-person conversations! This week at ICASSP, I finally had the opportunity to meet other PhD researchers going through the same grind!
