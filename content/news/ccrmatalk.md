I am honored and thrilled to have presented a Hearing Seminar today on 'Designing Interactive Generative Audio Models for Sound Design' at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA)!
 
I am grateful for the opportunity to share my PhD research with an exceptional group of academics and industry professionals. I thoroughly enjoyed our discussions and conversations during the seminar and look forward to continuing them.
 
Presenting at CCRMA, a hallowed ground for audio and music research, was such an incredible honor. Something about the building, the history of the place, the vibe, and its people inspires more creativity and makes you want to do more!!
 
Thank you, Malcolm Slaney, for this incredible opportunity to share my research with this amazing community.
