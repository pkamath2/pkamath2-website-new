I am a Ph.D. graduate from the National University of Singapore (NUS). My research interests lie at the intersection of generative AI and sound design. I am passionate about bridging the gap between arts and technology by designing intelligent interactive tools for creativity. During my PhD I was advised by [Dr. Suranga Nanayakkara](https://suranga.info/), [Dr. Kokil Jaidka](https://kokiljaidka.wordpress.com/), and [Dr. Lonce Wyse](https://lonce.org/).

<span style="background-color:yellow">I am currently open to collaborating on projects at the intersection of AI and sound design. If you interested in collaborating with me or are hiring for postdoc/industry research opportunities in audio, please reach out.</span>

Before NUS, I worked in the industry for ~15 years in various roles. I helped build and architect solutions for various financial institutions, such as Credit Suisse and Lehman Brothers, and consulting organizations, such as Capgemini and Oliver Wyman.

I believe that we all need to do more to improve gender diversity in tech. I co-founded the [Women Who Code network in Singapore](https://womenwhocode.com/singapore) in 2016 and led the network in the city as a [Director](https://str.sg/UaDP) until 2020. I was also involved in building developer communities for [YOW! Conferences](https://yowconference.com/) in the city.
